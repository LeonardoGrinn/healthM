<p>
<b>Definition of Personal Information and Definition of Protected Health Information</b></p><p>
In this Privacy Policy, we refer to “Personal Information,” meaning data about an individual who can be identified from that data, or by combining it with other data. Personal Information is usually your name in combination with another identifier, such as date of birth, postal address, email address, telephone number, or government-issued identification number. The specific definition of Personal information varies from one jurisdiction to another.</p><p>

Personal information does not include anonymous or aggregated data that can no longer be used to identify a specific person, even if combined with other data. We typically do not consider business information, such as one’s position, business name, title, business email, business phone number, business address, business fax, and other similar business information, to be Personal Information. Other information that is part of publicly accessible data sources may not be Personal Information. In contrast, “Protected Health Information” or “PHI” is information, including demographics, which relates to your past, present, or future physical or mental health, and the provision or payment of healthcare, that is created or received by a “Covered Entity”, such as certain “Health Plans” that we offer. The protection of PHI is governed by our Notice of Privacy Practices.</p><p>

<b>Personal Information Directly from You</b></p><p>

When you contact Americo, our Affiliates, or inquire about our products and services through our Site, we may collect or receive your name, email address, phone number, and date of birth, so that we may respond to your inquiry.</p><p>

When you make a claim, update your bank information, surrender your policy, withdraw from your claim, update your address, update your beneficiary, or otherwise seek service of your policy through our Site, we may collect Personal Information about you and information related to your request. This information may be collected through online forms, telephone, emails, and social media, and may include your name, address, policy number, bank information, address, and beneficiary information. We use the collected information to process and respond to your request.</p><p>

<b>Personal Information from Agents and Brokers</b></p><p>
When you inquire with an insurance agent or broker about our products or services or apply for our products or services through them, we may receive Personal Information from them such as your name, address, email address, and phone number.</p><p>

Agents and brokers may also provide us with certain biographical information about you, including social security number and health-related information (such as age, weight, smoking habits, etc.) about you and your family members in the application process.</p><p>

This Privacy Policy explains what we do with your Personal Information. Please contact your agent or broker directly and review their policy if you have questions about how they collect, use, process and share your PHI.</p><p>

<b>Personal Information from Non-Affiliates</b></p><p>
When you apply for products and services from a non-affiliate insurer whose policies we administer, we may receive Personal Information such as your name, address, email address and phone number. We may receive certain biographical information about you. We may also receive health-related information (such as age, weight, smoking habits, etc.) about you and your family members.</p><p>

We may also receive Personal Information from other non-affiliated third parties who supply us with information after you have executed a specific authorization. For example, you may authorize Americo or other insurers to share or obtain Personal Information with or from MIB, Inc., which operates an information exchange for insurers used to assist in the underwriting process.</p><p>

The collection, use, processing and disclosure of your Personal Information by non-affiliate third parties is governed by their own privacy policies, so please review those policies or contact those companies directly.</p><p>

When you visit our Site, we may collect non-Personal Information such as your IP address, device ID, browser setting, operating system, referring domain, language preferences, mobile carrier (if using a mobile device), action tags, and site activity. We do not use this information on its own to trace or identify person. It is collected even if you cancel or do not complete a purchase, registration, or order.</p><p>
