    <sup>1</sup><em>The policy’s guaranteed minimum death benefit is equal to the initial specified amount as defined in the policy and is guaranteed for the lifetime of the insured, assuming no loans, withdrawals or accelerations of the death benefit are taken. </em>
    <br>
    <sup>2</sup><em>Accelerated Benefit Payment Rider (Rider Series 2149): Benefits may vary by state and will not be available in all states. Certain limitations and exclusions apply. The permanent nursing home benefit is payable after a 90-day elimination period from the time confinement begins. Because accelerated benefit payments are treated as liens against the policy, interest will apply and will gradually decrease the proceeds payable. Please see Rider for all benefits and exclusions.</em>
    <br>
    <sup>3</sup><em>Accidental Death Benefit Rider (Rider Series 2169): Rider will pay an additional death benefit if death occurs due to accidental injury(ies) no later than 90 days following the date of the accident. The additional death benefit will be equal to 100% of the base policy death benefit if death is the result of an accidental injury, or 200% of the base policy death benefit if death is due to injury as a direct result of an accident while riding as a fare-paying passenger on a common carrier. Please see Rider for all benefits and exclusions.</em>
