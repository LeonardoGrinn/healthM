    <h1>SIMPLE SOLUTIONS. LASTING RESULTS</h1>
    <p>Lifetime Legacy is a senior wealth transfer planning product that was designed specifically for passing on a legacy. It is universal life insurance that guarantees a specific amount of money will go to the beneficiary at death. 
    <br><br>
    The concept is simple. Your client purchases the policy with a single payment. This payment creates a guaranteed amount of money that will be left to loved ones at death. No additional payments are needed, and there are never any worries about guaranteed amount changing.</p>
