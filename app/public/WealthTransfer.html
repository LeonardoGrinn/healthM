    <h1>THE BASICS OF WEALTH TRANSFER</h1>
    <p>Passing on wealth is something for which most people plan. Having a well-thought-out wealth transfer plan may help your clients:
    	<ul>
    		<li>Find more efficient ways to increase the amount of wealth they leave to their heirs</li>
    		<li>Plan for an income tax-free death benefit</li>
    		<li>Plan for efficiently passing through normal probate hassles</li>
    	</ul>
    </p>
    <p>Potential tax consequences are something most people don't think about. One solution to consider is a life insurance policy. Life insurance can be one of the most efficient means for your clients to leave a legacy.</p>
    <br>
   <blockquote cite="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/15/the-great-wealth-transfer-has-started.html">
		<strong>It's estimated that over the next several decades, a wealth transfer of roughly <br><span style="color: #847A18">$30 trillion</span> will pass from one generation to the next.</strong>*

   <br>
